// Functions are the FUNDAMENTAL MODULAR UNITS of JavaScript
// A function encloses a set of Statements

// Used for Code reuse
// information hiding
// and composition

// Function objects are linked to Function.prototype 
// (which in itself is linked to Object.prototype)

// Functions also have 2 additional properties
// 1. The functions context
// 2. The code that implements the behaviour

// Functions are objects and can therefore, 
// be stored in variable's objects and arrays
// They can be passed as arguments and returned from other functions


// A method is a function that is a property of an object and not a stand-alone function in itself.
// The think that is special about finctions is that they can be invoked
// To activate. One usually speaks of invoking a function or routine in a program. 
// In this sense, the term invoke is synonymous with call.
