// Objects are mutable keyed collections
// Objects include Functions, Arrays and Expressions, as well as Objects

// An object is a CONTAINER of properties where the property has a name and a value
// A name can be any string
// A value can be anything except undefined

// Objects are class free but PROTOTYPE is proveded to enable objects to inherit from each other
// this can reduce object initialization time and memory consumption
